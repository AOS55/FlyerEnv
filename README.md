A gymnasium environment for autonomous decision making in fixed-wing aircraft

## The Environments

### Point Navigation

```python
env = gymnasium.make("flyer-v1")
```

In this task the aircraft must navigate to a specified 3D goal point in space in the shortest possible time.


### Trajectory Following

```python
env = gymnasium.make("trajectory-v1")
```

    <em>Trajectory Following</em>
</p>

In this task the aircraft must follow a trajectory created by a moving target, maintaining on target maximizes the reward. The possible trajectory primitives are as follows:
- `sl`, maintain straight and level flight.
- `climb`, climb to a specified level at a fixed climb angle.
- `descend`, descend to a specified level at a fixed descent angle.
- `lt`, turn left to a specified heading at a fixed rate.
- `rt`, turn right to a specified heading at a fixed rate.


### Runway Landing

```python
env = gymnasium.make("runway_landing-v1")
```

### Forced Landing

```python
env = gymnasium.make("forced_landing-v1")
```

## Installation

```pip install flyer-env```

## Usage

```python
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("flyer-v1", render_mode="human")

done = truncated = False
while not (done or truncated):
    action = ... # Your agent code goes here
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```
